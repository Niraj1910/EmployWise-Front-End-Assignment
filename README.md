Installing Dependencies

Run npm install to install all dependencies, including:

react-hot-toast for notifications.
tailwindcss for styling.
Development tools like typescript, eslint, and vite.
Assumptions and Considerations
API: Assumes an external API provides user data (getUsers, deleteUser) with fields: id, first_name, last_name, avatar, email. Update src/api.ts with your API endpoints.
Routing: Assumes an edit page exists at /users/:id/edit. You may need to implement this route.
Pagination: Server-side pagination is assumed. If the API doesnâ€™t support it, client-side pagination would need to be added.
Avatar: If avatar URLs fail or are missing, the UI displays the image as-is; no fallback is implemented.
Styling: Uses Tailwind CSS for a responsive design, tested on modern browsers.
